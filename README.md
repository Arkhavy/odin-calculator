# The Odin Project

# foundations-calculator

As asked in the introduction of [the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator), the calculator project will be the last project of the foundations course of The Odin Project. The goal is to use everything learned through TOP, HTML, CSS and JS alike. I will for now work on the bare minimum on the project, unless I find something interesting enough to be pushed from my point of view to practice a bit more.
